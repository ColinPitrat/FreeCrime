Some work has been done to identify GTA data files in the `file` utility:
https://mailman.astron.com/pipermail/file/2021-March/000468.html

The commit references some interesting resources:
 * Classic GTA documentation and research:
    https://gitlab.com/classic-gta/gta-data-nonfree
 * Official RenderWare documentation available from EA:
    https://github.com/electronicarts/RenderWare3Docs
 * Lots of community research in the GTAMods wiki:
    https://gtamods.com/wiki
 * Some file formats (fonts & cut scenes) described here:
    https://misc.daniel-marschall.de/spiele/gta1/

There are tools allowing to edit many of the resource files:
