display_map.py:
 - Flat sprite disappear when perfectly vertical
 - Car remap doesn't work? (but no example!)
 - Slopes lids often have a black border
 - Sides of slopes are not properly displayed (they should be cut from the texture, not the texture fully mapped).

modify_cmp.py:
 - Support slopes properly
