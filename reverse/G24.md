# GTA 1 G24 file format

The G24 file format stores graphics and objects data for 24-bits version.

Most of the information in this page comes from
https://www.moddb.com/downloads/cityscape-data-structure

The format is very similar to the [GRY](GRY.md) file format. This page only
highlights the differences.

TODO: dig into the G24 specificities.
