# FreeCrime

FreeCrime is a clone of [GTA 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(video_game))
(Grand Theft Auto) written in [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))
using [Bevy](https://bevy.org/) with the objectives of:

 - reproducing the original game as faithfully as possible when provided the appropriate resources
   (including London 1969 and London 1961 mission packs)
 - support mods for the original games
 - provide a similar game experience with free/open source resources for players who don't have the
   original game
 - maybe, in the future, support the [GTA 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_2) game
   too.

## Current status

There is no code written, reverse engineering of the original game is on-going.
The on-going reverse engineering work is documented in the [reverse](reverse/README.md)
subdirectory.
